# logo-generator

## Description

This project was made as a means of learning how to use jest and inquirer in a different way. This was also useful in terms of figuring out the limits of 'module.exports' and the like. 

This project also solves the problem of not knowing how to make a proper logo for a website. Instead of mulling over mspaint or some other site for awhile, one could simply produce a logo here to use instead.
